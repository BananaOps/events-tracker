## About EventsTracker 
 
EventsTracker is open-source alternative to Datadog events or Newrelic custom events. The solution is composed of an api and a cli that enable the creation and retrieval of events in a Mongo or FeretDB database.

The idea behind this solution is to provide a simple way of keeping track of everything that happens on your platform, especially in a world of distributed services. Track the start and end of a deployment incident or the opening of an incident.

Each time an event is created, we create a log in json format, which enables EventsTracker to be coupled with a logging solution such as Opensearch or Loki to correlate with logs and metrics.
